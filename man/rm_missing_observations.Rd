\title{Remove Observations with Missing Response Values}
\usage{
rm_missing_observations(yhat_train, X_train, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{yhat_train}{Numeric vector representing the response variable (methylation levels) in the training set.}

\item{X_train}{Matrix or data frame of predictors (SNP data) in the training set.
Dimensions: Observations (rows) x SNPs (columns).}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print warnings about removed NAs.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements: 'yhat_train' and 'X_train', both filtered to exclude
observations with missing response values.
}
\description{
Removes any observations in the training set where the response variable (methylation levels)
is missing. This function ensures that both predictor (SNPs) and response datasets are aligned,
which is crucial in subsequent analyses of methylome-wide association studies.
