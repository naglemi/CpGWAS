\title{Hyperparameter Tuning for Elastic Net Model}
\usage{
glmnet_tune_alpha(
  X_train,
  yhat_train,
  n_fold = 5,
  verbose = FALSE,
  lambda_choice = "1se",
  alphas = seq(0, 1, 0.1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_train}{A matrix or data frame of SNP data used as predictors in the training set.
Dimensions: Number of Observations (rows) x Number of SNPs (columns).}

\item{yhat_train}{A numeric vector representing the response variable (methylation levels)
in the training set. Length should match the number of rows in X_train.}

\item{n_fold}{Integer, specifying the number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print detailed tuning results.}

\item{lambda_choice}{Character, specifying the method for choosing lambda
('min' for minimum MSE, '1se' for one-standard-error rule).}

\item{alphas}{Numeric vector, specifying the alpha values to iterate over in tuning.}
}
\value{
A list containing the fitted model, non-zero coefficients, optimal parameters,
and correlation on test data.
}
\description{
This function performs hyperparameter tuning for an elastic net model. It is particularly
designed for methylome-wide association studies where the relationship between SNPs (Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and methylation levels is being modeled. The function iterates over
a range of alpha values to find the optimal lambda using cross-validation.
