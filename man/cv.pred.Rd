\title{Cross-Validation for Elastic Net Model in Methylation Studies}
\usage{
cv.pred(
  SNPs,
  y,
  n_fold = 5,
  omit_folds_with_na_r = FALSE,
  record_runtime = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SNPs}{A matrix or data frame representing SNP data.
Dimensions: Number of Observations (rows) x Number of SNPs (columns).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing methylation levels corresponding to each SNP observation.
Length should match the number of rows in SNPs.}

\item{n_fold}{Integer, specifying the number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{omit_folds_with_na_r}{Logical, indicating whether to omit folds with NA in results.}

\item{record_runtime}{Logical, indicating whether to record the runtime of the function.}
}
\value{
A list containing the best model, its MSE, correlation, SNP weights (with names),
and total runtime if record_runtime is TRUE.
}
\description{
Conducts k-fold cross-validation on SNP data against methylation levels using an elastic net model.
This function splits the data into k folds, trains the model on k-1 folds, and evaluates it on the
remaining fold, iterating through all folds. It selects the best model based on MSE, and outputs
the corresponding correlation, MSE, and SNP weight vector for the best model.

\dontrun{
cv_results <- cv.pred(SNPs, y, n_fold = 5, omit_folds_with_na_r = FALSE, record_runtime = TRUE)
