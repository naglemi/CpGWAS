\title{MethylationInput Class}
\description{
Encapsulates the processing of input data for methylation analysis in a genomic context. This class facilitates
the integration of methylation data, SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data in PLINK2 binary format, and
covariate information. It supports operations such as data loading, preprocessing, and alignment for subsequent
analysis stages.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{methylations}}{A matrix containing methylation beta values or intensities for genomic positions.}

\item{\code{methylations_positions}}{An integer vector indicating the genomic positions of methylation sites.}

\item{\code{genotype_IDs}}{A character vector listing the IDs of genotypes corresponding to the samples in the methylation data.}

\item{\code{pvar_pointer}}{An external pointer to variant information, compatible with PLINK2 binary format.}

\item{\code{pvar_dt}}{A data table summarizing variant information, typically including variant IDs, chromosomes, and positions.}
