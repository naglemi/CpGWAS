Description: CpGWAS is used to support methylome-wide association studies. Similar
    to commonly-used TWAS methods, this package works by first constructing models
    to predict methylation as a function of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
    with training on a population segment for which both methylation and SNP data
    are available. Next, this prediction model is used to predict methylation for the
    remainder of the population, for which SNP data is available but methylation data
    is not. Finally, the predicted methylation values can be used as explanatory
    variables to predict phenotypes of interest.
